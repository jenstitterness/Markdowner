## Markdowner

Markdowner is a markdown viewer built using node-webkit, node.js, and backbone.js. 

#### To build:

1. From root folder run ```grunt dist:mac```  or  ```grunt dist:win``` (linux not tested yet). 
2. Look in ```./dist``` for the build files
3. Since this app is under development, --force flag might be needed to build ;)

#### Todo:

- Make UI pretty
- add export to html/pdf
- add support for save locations
- add support for Github style markdown
- add support for different markdown styles
- look into GH integration
